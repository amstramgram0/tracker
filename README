				Tracker Project
			       =================

'tracker' is an hybrid trustworthy disassembler that uses dynamic and static
approaches to get an as complete as possible disassembly of a binary with a
minimum of false positive instructions gathered (tracker must provide a proof
that every single trace it displays can be executable for real with an input
that trigger its execution).

It uses a fuzzer to extract a first couple of traces from the given binary and,
then, provides new inputs to the fuzzer with the help of static-analysis
techniques (symbolic execution and abstract interpretation applied on a CFG
extracted from previous traces).

Current student project
-----------------------
For now, we need to build a way to gather all the traces into a CFG that can be
grown by further new traces brought by the fuzzer or the result of some
static-analysis result.

This project may requires to build a very "quick and dirty" fuzzer to be able
to collect several traces and gather it together. But, we do not expect any
work on the static-analysis part.

Build the project
-----------------
This project requires the capstone library and a Linux platform.
To build it:

#> cd tracker/
#> make
